A deadline set by many countries to go carbon-free by 2050 has led to rising adoption of zero-emission vehicles and Tesla has been at the forefront of this transformation, selling long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs).Despite a recent pullback, its stock has soared 650% in the last year, helped also by a cult following for CEO Elon Musk.But it is no longer the only electrification play in town.Volkswagen, the German company competing with Toyota to be the worldâs biggest vehicle seller by volume, laid out its ambitious plan to turn 70% of European sales at its core VW brand electric during its âpower dayâ last Monday.The plan, months in the making, has helped to fuel a Tesla-esque rally in the 83-year old companyâs shares, with CEO Herbert Diess even taking to Twitter, Elon Musk-style to crow as the companyâs market value crossed 100 billion euros ($119 billion) earlier this month.The stock is now up 52% year-to-date, taking its market value to 143 billion euros.âWith VWâs CEO really pushing the message on BEVs across all channels (conventional media, investors as well as Twitter and LinkedIn) we believe the private investors are picking up on this story and could be quite a powerful force by themselves,â said Barclays analyst Kai Alexander Mueller.German rival BMW, meanwhile, said on Wednesday it was aiming for half of its sales to be non-fossil fuel vehicles by 2030, and that around 90% of its market categories would have fully-electric models available by 2023
