The past year introduced a lot more people to the world of Chromebooks as everyone snatched them up for remote learning and at-home work during the pandemic. It's likely because of this that I spent more time fielding questions about them from family and friends than I have since they first launched in 2011. Most of my Chromebook conversations are with people buying them for kids. But these Q&A sessions regularly end with them asking "Should I buy one for myself?" And the stock answer is usually, "It depends on your needs." But after just a little digging, many people realize they simply don't need to do any more than what can be done on a Chromebook. Where to beginNot sure if a Chromebook is right for you? Start by making a list of exactly what you need to do on a computer. Include what you'd like to do, too. If everything on your list is done in a web browser, congratulations, Chromebooks are a perfect fit. So many things, especially when it comes to productivity tasks like word processing and spreadsheets, can happen in a browser or with a web app. Web apps are essentially websites that function like downloadable mobile apps and Google has a web store full of them. If you can't find a web app to meet your needs, all modern Chromebooks can run Android apps, too, from the Google Play store. It's basically this combination and some other key Chrome OS features (I'll get to those in a sec) that make Chromebooks an easier recommendation than they were even just a few years ago.
