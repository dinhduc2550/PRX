The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is designed to deliver everything you could possibly want in a big-screen Android phone. And based on my testing, it pretty much does. For $1,199 â or $100 more than the iPhone 12 Pro Max â you a get dynamic 6.8-inch display and dual telephoto lenses for crazy zoom power. Plus, the S21 Ultra supports the S Pen, a first for the Galaxy S series.The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes in a sleeker design and offers faster performance from Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chip. And, unlike the regular Galaxy S21, you don't have to make nearly as many trade-offs. You get a better main 108MP camera, a glass back (instead of plastic), more RAM, and a higher-res display.As you'll see in my Galaxy S21 Ultra review, there are some trade-offs, including the lack of a charger in the box. But overall, this is one of the best phones money can buy for those willing to pay a premium and the best Android phone overall. Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review cheat sheetThe dynamic display on the Galaxy S21 Ultra delivers a smooth 120Hz refresh rate and sharpest WQHD resolution at the same time. And it's amazingly bright and colorful to boot.The dual telephoto lenses (3x and 10x optical zoom) get you very close to your subject, and the new Zoom Lock feature keeps things steadier with digital Space Zoom.The S Pen support is nice to have, but you have to purchase the stylus and a case to hold it separately. At $1,199, the S21 Ultra isn't cheap, but it's $200 less than the S20 Ultra. However, you don't get a charger in the box or a microSD card slot.The larger fingerprint sensor is welcome, making the S21 Ultra easier to unlock. The 11.5 hours of battery life is excellent for a 5G phone.
