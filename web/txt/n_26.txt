Alienware m15 R4 and Alienware m17 R4 laptops have been refreshed by Dell to include Cherry MX ultra low profile mechanical keyboards, with per-key lighting. According to Dell, the new keyboards aim to be an extension of the gamer's senses, and allow you to press deeper with more emphasis. This mechanical switch delivers a full 1.8mm of key travel in a self-cleaning mechanism. Its two-piece keycap structure and cross-point contact system ensure precision and wobble-free keystrokes during intense virtual gaming sessions.Many gamers prefer mechanical keyboards because they are more responsive, and are usually more durable. For some of us, a mechanical keyboard just feels better to use, plus the sound of a mechanical keyboard can be good feedback as well. Apart from the change in keyboards, the laptops still run on 10th Gen Intel Core processors and offer up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU support.Dell Alienware m15 R4, Dell Alienware m17 R4 priceThe Dell Alienware m17 R4 gaming laptop is priced starting at $1,899 (roughly Rs.1,37,600), whereas the Dell Alienware m15 R4 gaming laptop is priced starting at $1,799 (roughly Rs. 1,30,300).
