The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is designed to deliver everything you could possibly want in a big-screen Android phone. And based on my testing, it pretty much does. For $1,199  or $100 more than the iPhone 12 Pro Max you a get dynamic 6.8-inch display and dual telephoto lenses for crazy zoom power. Plus, the S21 Ultra supports the S Pen, a first for the Galaxy S series.SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 ULTRA SPECSDisplay: 6.8 inches AMOLED (3200 x 1400); 10 to 120HzCPU: Snapdragon 888RAM: 12GB, 16GBStorage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GBRear cameras: 108MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultra wide (f/2.2), 10MP telephoto (3x zoom, f/2.4), 10MP telephoto (10x zoom, f/4.9), laser AF sensorFront camera: 40MP (f/2.2)Video: 8K 30 fps/4K 60 fpsBattery: 5,000 mAhBattery life: 11 hours 25 min (60Hz), 10:07 (adaptive)Wireless: 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, UWBSize: 6.5 x 2.97 x 0.35 inchesWeight: 8.08 ouncesThe Galaxy S21 Ultra comes in a sleeker design and offers faster performance from Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chip. And, unlike the regular Galaxy S21, you don't have to make nearly as many trade-offs. You get a better main 108MP camera, a glass back (instead of plastic), more RAM, and a higher-res display.Samsung Galaxy S21 review What should you buy?
