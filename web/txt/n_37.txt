The Amazon-backed food delivery has been held up by the British government as a sign the City of London can still attract major Initial Public Offerings (IPO) following the United Kingdomâs exit from the European Union.It is set to be Londonâs biggest IPO since Glencore in May 2011, according to data provided by the London Stock Exchange.A London stock market listing by Allied Irish Banks in 2017 is excluded from the data as it had a small listing in Ireland at the time.Deliveroo will also be the biggest tech IPO on the LSE, dwarfing The Hut Group from last year -- which had a 5.4 billion pound market capitalisation at time of listing -- and the since-delisted Worldpay Group from 2015.Deliveroo said it had set a price range for its listing of between 3.90 and 4.60 pounds per share which will give it a market value of between 7.6 billion pounds and 8.8 billion pounds ($10-5 billion and $12 billion), excluding any shares offered as part of an over-allotment issue.An announcement to investors seen by Reuters said that the deal size would be 1.5-1.6 billion pounds, rising to 1.7 billion pounds after the over-allotment of shares.Of this, new shares will raise 1 billion pounds for the company and the rest will be made up by existing shareholders selling part of their stake.Deliveroo has opted not to pursue a premium listing -- ruling it out of inclusion in the FTSE indices -- which allows founder and chief executive Will Shu to retain enhanced shareholder rights.In a short trading update, Deliveroo added that the total gross transaction value on its platform - which measures the total value of orders it receives - was up 121% in January and February this year compared to the same period in 2020.âWe have seen a strong start to 2021 and we are only at the start of an exciting journey in a large, fast-growing online food delivery market, with a huge opportunity ahead,â Shu said in a statement.JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are global coordinators and bookrunners along with Bank of America, Citi, Jefferies and Numis.
