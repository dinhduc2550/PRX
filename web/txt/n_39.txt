If you're reading this, we're guessing you still haven't been able to get ahold of the highly coveted Sony PlayStation 5. Low inventory at major retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, Amazon, Walmart and Sony itself means many gamers have been stuck in a frustrating and familiar routine: Catch wind of a PS5 inventory drop, get your hopes up, frantically click over and over, wait in a queue and instead of a PS5, you get the sad "sold out" message. But fear not! There are ways to improve your chances. First, don't wait until you find out about a PS5 restock; check the stores' inventory links yourself daily or even several times daily. (We've got them all lined up below.) If you do chance upon some PS5 availability, use as many devices and web browsers as you can. On a desktop, for example, you could open the retailer's page in Firefox, Chrome and Edge. Then you could do likewise on your tablet and phone. It's like with lottery tickets: The more you have, the better your chances of winning.If you're starting to crack and considering buying a PS5 right now, you can do so, but at the cost of an obscene markup on sites like eBay and StockX. On eBay, for example, we've seen a PS5 priced well over $1,000. The PS5 is available in two versions: There's a $500 model with a Blu-ray drive and an otherwise identical $400 digital-only version with no disc slot. At this point, people are happy to get their hands on either one, but if you don't have a library of optical discs -- for Blu-ray movies, used games or old PS4 games -- CNET recommends that you go with the $400 version.
